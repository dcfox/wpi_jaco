(1) Have the arm move to a Cartesian position
(2) Have the fingers pick something up
(3) Have the arm move to second Cartesian position
This is all done using the actions in wpi_jaco_msgs/action

Current issues:
	Not sure how to write an action that uses another action
	Don't know what locations we want yet.
		Will need something that prints coordinates
	Don't know what coordinates mean open hand/closed hand
	Closed hand should be changed to velocity since it will never completely close
